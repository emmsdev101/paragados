       the actual Accreditation Process
    </h2>
    <div class="flex-1">

      <p>
        The whole activity started with planning where everyone of us –
        students- as well as our course facilitator was involved and
        actively participated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two or three physical class sessions were devoted to planning.
        Originally, the class was divided into three groups: one to visit
        and evaluate a private junior high school in Bacolod City, Negros
        Occidental, one in University of Antique and one in the main
        campus of ISUFST. However, due to a reason beyond anyone’s
        control, the class settled to visit the last two state
        universities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific students were identified who should go with the ISUFST
        group and who should go with the University of Antique. Both were
        to conduct a mock accreditation for the institutions BSED (English
        and Math) degree offerings, specifically, in Area III only using
        the accreditation instrument of AACCUP.
      </p>
      <p>
        A session was spent online in the briefing by the course
        Professor, Dr. Sybel Joy F. Labis on the concept of AACCUP
        accreditation and on how to use its instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contingencies anent the activity like food and snacks, class
        uniform, transportation, itinerary, etc. were also included in the
        planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I belonged to the group assigned to visit ISUFST Main Campus in
        Tiwi, Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo on May 12, 2023.
      </p>
      <p>Below was the itinerary for our group:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The group arrived at the area on time. Upon arrival, Dr. Labis
          and the rest made a courtesy call with the University President,
          Dr. Nordy Siason who was around that time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Starting at 2:00 o’ clock PM and the next two hours we conducted
          the mock accreditation. There were two groups: one for the BSED
          major in English curriculum and the another for the BSED major
          in Math curriculum. I belonged to the former group.
        </li>
        <li>
          At around 3:30 o’ clock PM, the class started sharing each
          group’s outputs with Dr. Labis facilitating. The discussion was
          enriching and much have been learned from the insights of one
          another and from the wisdom of the course professor. When the
          sharing had been through, the group started to pick up, did a
          short tour of the campus and took some groufies and pictures
          before parted ways to go each home.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Insights and challenges encountered during the accreditation
        process
      </h3>
      <p>
        Accreditation as an activity or process is not new to me, as I
        mentioned above. I have helped during the accreditations of
        several programs in the university campus I am serving. So
        practically, the activity we conducted at ISUFST Main Campus was
        generally smooth sailing for me personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is inevitable that there are some minor challenges
        that I encountered during the activity day. Firstly, the distance
        from my place. The site we visited was quite far from our place
        and since I have no private car or service vehicle, I had to
        commute and had to ask a classmate who has a car to wait for me in
        Zarraga, Iloilo so I can hitch ride with him along with our
        professor and two of my classmates. Since travelling by bus is not
        predictable, I came late in our rendezvous. I was ashamed to let
        them wait for me. I hoped they did not wait for me for a long
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, travelling for me is always a challenge since I take
        maintenance medications for my hypertension and diabetes. We
        arrived at the site on time but I had to eat my lunch first in
        their campus cafeteria for me to take my meds. As a consequence,
        I started my tasks quite a little late than the rest of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, the documents given to us for evaluation were scanned
        copies the University submitted to AACCUP last year when they
        applied for Level 4 status of their BSED program with all the
        field of specializations under it. The fact that the AACCUP
        itself has closed the system, it was a real challenge for us to
        verify the claims especially that most of the claims or documents
        were supplemented by supporting documents that were hyperlinked
        but since the whole sets of documents were in PDF form, there was
        no way for us to click and open those links. Triangulation then
        was a definite challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, although we only looked into Area III - Curriculum and
        Instruction for only one specialization (I was assigned to BSED -
        English group), the time given to us to check the documents
        against the benchmarks in the six parameters of Area III was too
        short for us to have done much. It would have been more enriching
        if time would not have been limited. If we were to count, our
        travel time to and from that place was just equal or even longer
        that the time we spent for the actual doing of the thing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-1">
      <h3 class="mb-3">
        Lessons learned and personal growth from conducting the
        Accreditation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Generally, the activity was very enriching, fruitful and
        productyive. There were many things I personally learned from the
        whole process starting from the planning stage until the
        culmination of the accreditation day. For one, accreditation is a
        teamwork. Cooperation and participation of everyone in the Team
        are significant for the attainment of the objectives of the
        activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another is that, studying about the things to be done and how to
        do them is also very important. There is no better substitute than
        to go to the battle armed and ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, evaluation is a process of being reasonable, just and fair.
        Making judgments should never rely on what are being presented per
        se. Triangulation is a must. If an accreditor thinks that the
        documents presented are lacking, he/she should find all means to
        verify the claims. He/she should always check and go over his /her
        ratings given and compromise or adjust if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the activity refreshed and enhanced the training I
        attended with ACCUP on Outcomes-based Accreditation. Though I have
        not been called by AACCUP to serve as accreditor so far, yet I
        completed a short term training course on it. The activity is a
        welcoming prelude to the Level 4 accreditation that we are
        preparing for come August or September.
