      Over-all, the activity was successful, enriching and truly a learning experience. It strengthened the  concepts and theories we discussed in class about evaluation in general and about accreditation in particular. 
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, there is wisdom behind the inclusion of this course in the PhD in Education major in Curriculum Development degree program. This is a course that should be retained continued to be made as a specialization course in the said program because of its undeniable importance and relevance to the whole educational system.
    </p>

      I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and energy of my classmates. Perhaps it was due to their age which spells dynamism and idealism. But doctoral students student be like this in the first place. They should exude passion and diligence in performing the tasks assigned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I found the experience very enriching. I loved the whole thing. It brings back the freshmemories we in the campus are doing everytime there is accreditation happening. I am always assigned in Area II-Faculty across prgrams. My first hand experiences have made me familiar with the process although I have to admit that reporting was quite a challenge for me. It is really something when stating the results of oneâ€™s evaluation in a tactful and cordial manner. My knowledge and background on accreditation increased. My skills expanded and my outlook on evaluation widened.

      Program design, evaluation and quality assurance, though distinct from each other, are highly related and are indispensable in curriculum development. All of them require thorough planning. The first two (progam design and evaluation), as applied in education, are geared towards ensuring quality assurance. Both of them are major and crucial functions in curriculum development. Progfram designs should always be updated and reviewed. They should go through evaluation periodically to ascertain their responsiveness and relevance. Evaluation equates to quality assurance. 
    </p>

      As a student of curriculum, I wish I could be given an opportunity to apply in real accreditation setting what I have learned in this course and in the training with AACCUP last time on Outcomes-based Accredation, which is exactly the application of what we did during the mock accreditation in ISUFST. By applying my learnings in actual conduct of accreditations, I could enhance my knowledge and skills and can firsthandedly extend my help in the cause of promoting and ensuring quality education.
