          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Jovas. I am a faculty member of West Visayas State
            University – Calinog Campus. I am a graduate student of WVSU Main
            Campus College of Education pursuing Doctor of Philosophy in
            Education major in Curriculum Development. 
          </p>
          <p>Allow me to take you to
            our journey during our practicum in the course CDV 606 – Educational
            Evaluation : Theory and Practice this second semester, AY 2022-2023
            under Dr. Sybel Joy F. Labis as our course facilitator.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            We visited the main campus of a state university somewhere in the
            northern part of Iloilo Province of the Panay Island, Region VI
            Western Visayas, Philippines and we looked into their Bachelor of
            Secondary Education program, English and Math specializations, to
            evaluate the merits of these program offerings based on the
            accreditation tools of the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges
            and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), Inc. Specifically, we
            evaluated the said programs using the Area 3 (Curriculum and
            Instruction) instruments of the said accrediting agency.

            <h3 class="mb-3">The Accreditation Proccess: A brief overview and its significance</h3>              
            <div>
              <p>Accreditation is a form of evaluation. It is a process of looking into the strengths, and weaknesses as well as areas which are needing improvement of programs and institutions in certain parameters determined or established by the accrediting body, normally a third party or an external party. It is a means of ensuring that programs and administration of these programs are within acceptable standards within the level they are being accredited. The ultimate end of accreditation is quality assurance. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Accreditation is important for a number of reasons. It provides
                assurance to the public that an organization program or
                institution has met established standards of quality, and that
                it has undergone a rigorous evaluation process by an independent
                accrediting agency. Accreditation can also help organizations to
                improve their operations and outcomes by providing them with
                feedback and guidance on areas where they need to improve.
              </p>
              <p>
                For educational institutions, accreditation is particularly
                important because it can impact a student’s ability to transfer
                credits to other institutions or to obtain professional
                licensure. Many employers also look for job candidates who have
                graduated from accredited institutions as it is seen as a mark
                of quality and rigor.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Philippines, state and even local colleges and
                universities are submitting their curricular programs and course
                offering to AACCUP for accreditation. Normally, AACCUP evaluates
                10 areas (10 Standards/ Key Result Areas) in all programs it
                evaluates. These areas are :
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Area I : Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives</li>
                <li>Area II : Faculty</li>
                <li>Area III : Curriculum and Instruction</li>
                <li>Area IV: Support to Students</li>
                <li>Area V : Research</li>
                <li>Area VI: Extension and Community Involvement Area</li>
                <li>VII: Library Area</li>
                <li>VIII: Physical Plant and Facilities</li>
                <li>Area IX: Laboratories</li>
                <li>Area X : Administration</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A certain degree program being submitted for accreditation has
                to obtain the desired over-all mean of these areas to be granted
                or awarded the level of accreditation it is applying for. As the
                level advances, so is the over-all mean needed to obtain the
                accreditation. That is to say, Level 1 needs a lower over-all
                mean rating compared to Level 2, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every area has parameters with benchmarks/standards that need to
                be satisfied. For example, Area 3 – Curriculum and Instruction,
                has six parameters and each parameter has indicators which the
                accreditor concerned has to rate (Item Rating) from NA (Not
                Applicable) to 5 (Excellent) and solve for the System –
                Implementation-Outcome (SIOM) Mean and eventually, for the
                Parameter Mean (PM) based on physical and triangulated evidences and
                documents presented.
              </p>
              <p>
                To illustrate, Area 3 Parameter A has 3 System Inputs and
                Processes. System 1 has 3 benchmarks or indicators. So, each
                indicator should be rated by the accreditor with either NA, 0, 1, 2,
                3, 4 or 5 as the case may be and placed at the end of each
                indicator in the accreditation instrument. Then the means of
                the 3 indicators should be reflected in the SIOM column in the
                same instrument. When all the indicators – each in the System
                Inputs and Processes, Implementation and Outcome/s – have been
                rated, the Parameter Mean (M) shall now be computed by adding
                the 3 means and dividing the sum by three. The result will be
                the rating of the program in Parameter A of Area 3.
