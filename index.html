          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Jovas. I am a faculty member of West Visayas State
            University – Calinog Campus. I am a graduate student of WVSU Main
            Campus College of Education pursuing Doctor of Philosophy in
            Education major in Curriculum Development. 
          </p>
          <p>Allow me to take you to
            our journey during our practicum in the course CDV 606 – Educational
            Evaluation : Theory and Practice this second semester, AY 2022-2023
            under Dr. Sybel Joy F. Labis as our course facilitator.</p>
          <p class="lead mb-5">
            We visited the main campus of a state university somewhere in the
            northern part of Iloilo Province of the Panay Island, Region VI
            Western Visayas, Philippines and we looked into their Bachelor of
            Secondary Education program, English and Math specializations, to
            evaluate the merits of these program offerings based on the
            accreditation tools of the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges
            and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), Inc. Specifically, we
            evaluated the said programs using the Area 3 (Curriculum and
            Instruction) instruments of the said accrediting agency.
          </p>
          <div class="flex-grow-1 mb-5">
            <h3 class="mb-3">The Accreditation Proccess: A brief overview and its significance</h3>              
            <div>
              <p>Accreditation is a form of evaluation. It is a process of looking into the strengths, and weaknesses as well as areas which are needing improvement of programs and institutions in certain parameters determined or established by the accrediting body, normally a third party or an external party. It is a means of ensuring that programs and administration of these programs are within acceptable standards within the level they are being accredited. The ultimate end of accreditation is quality assurance. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Accreditation is important for a number of reasons. It provides
                assurance to the public that an organization program or
                institution has met established standards of quality, and that
                it has undergone a rigorous evaluation process by an independent
                accrediting agency. Accreditation can also help organizations to
                improve their operations and outcomes by providing them with
                feedback and guidance on areas where they need to improve.
              </p>
              <p>
                For educational institutions, accreditation is particularly
                important because it can impact a student’s ability to transfer
                credits to other institutions or to obtain professional
                licensure. Many employers also look for job candidates who have
                graduated from accredited institutions as it is seen as a mark
                of quality and rigor.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Philippines, state and even local colleges and
                universities are submitting their curricular programs and course
                offering to AACCUP for accreditation. Normally, AACCUP evaluates
                10 areas (10 Standards/ Key Result Areas) in all programs it
                evaluates. These areas are :
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Area I : Vision, Mission, Goals, and Objectives</li>
                <li>Area II : Faculty</li>
                <li>Area III : Curriculum and Instruction</li>
                <li>Area IV: Support to Students</li>
                <li>Area V : Research</li>
                <li>Area VI: Extension and Community Involvement Area</li>
                <li>VII: Library Area</li>
                <li>VIII: Physical Plant and Facilities</li>
                <li>Area IX: Laboratories</li>
                <li>Area X : Administration</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A certain degree program being submitted for accreditation has
                to obtain the desired over-all mean of these areas to be granted
                or awarded the level of accreditation it is applying for. As the
                level advances, so is the over-all mean needed to obtain the
                accreditation. That is to say, Level 1 needs a lower over-all
                mean rating compared to Level 2, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every area has parameters with benchmarks/standards that need to
                be satisfied. For example, Area 3 – Curriculum and Instruction,
                has six parameters and each parameter has indicators which the
                accreditor concerned has to rate (Item Rating) from NA (Not
                Applicable) to 5 (Excellent) and solve for the System –
                Implementation-Outcome (SIOM) Mean and eventually, for the
                Parameter Mean (PM) based on physical and triangulated evidences and
                documents presented.
              </p>
              <p>
                To illustrate, Area 3 Parameter A has 3 System Inputs and
                Processes. System 1 has 3 benchmarks or indicators. So, each
                indicator should be rated by the accreditor with either NA, 0, 1, 2,
                3, 4 or 5 as the case may be and placed at the end of each
                indicator in the accreditation instrument. Then the means of
                the 3 indicators should be reflected in the SIOM column in the
                same instrument. When all the indicators – each in the System
                Inputs and Processes, Implementation and Outcome/s – have been
                rated, the Parameter Mean (M) shall now be computed by adding
                the 3 means and dividing the sum by three. The result will be
                the rating of the program in Parameter A of Area 3.

              and design relevant and quality curricular programs and offerings.
              They are also being trained to be hands-on educational evaluators
              so they will become assets to the educational system in general
              and to their respective units and stations in particular.

              Importance of accreditation in ensuring quality
              education
            </h3>
            <p>
              Accreditation aims for and promotes quality education. It is very
              important if not indispensable to the whole educational system
              particularly in ensuring that program offerings are at par with
              standards set by authorities and accrediting bodies. When program
              offerings and institutions are accredited, the ones who most
              benefit are the major clients of the educational institutions who
              are the students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consequently, parents become confident that their children are in
              good hands and that they get the worth of their money. Even if we
              say that public education in the Philippines is free across all
              levels, accreditation is a means to determine that the taxpayers’
              money is well spent. After all, quality education is the thrust of all
              stakeholders of an educational institution.
            </p>
            <p>
              That is why, even in accreditation processes, there is an
              involvement or presence of students, alumni, community and local
              government officials and whose views and ideas become sources of
              information if not strong bases for triangulation of claims the
              institution or the program being accredited are establishing.

              Explanation of how accreditation enhances program design and
              evaluation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Accreditation enhances program design and evaluation since it is
              the very core of this process. It establishes the credibility of offering
               programs by higher education institutions. The meticulous process of
              accreditation spells out the very essence of evaluation to ensure
              its ultimate end which is quality education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accreditation ensures also that as degree offering advances in
              terms of number of years which it is being offered, the quality of
              its systems and inputs, its implementation as well as its outputs
              also advances accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also promotes quality of program offerings by setting
              benchmarks amoung institutions with lower-level accreditations
              with those who have already advanced in the field of
              accreditation.

            <h3 class="mb-3">Personal insights</h3>
            <p>
              Personally, I always believe that accreditation is a potent tool
              to ensure quality and relevant education. My a little more than
              two decades of accreditation experiences in the institution where
              I render service as a faculty member has seen tremendous
              improvements and developments that are in place now because of
              accreditations that have been conducted so far.
            </p>
            <p>
              While meeting the standards of the level a program in trying to
              get and eventually pass is definitely tedious and demanding
              physically, emotionally and mentally; nevertheless, the positive
              result when the level applied for is granted, is fulfilling and
              gratifying.
            </p>
            <p>
              All stakeholders become happy afterwards at the thought that the
              institution that they all support and form part of has indeed
              reasons for existing and for continuing to offer degree programs found
              to be of quality and relevant by the accrediting body.

            Description of the Identified and Visited Institution
          </h2>
          <div class="flex-1">
            <h3>HISTORY OF ISUFST</h3>
            <p>On June 22, 1957, Congressman Ricardo Y. Ladrido authored and sponsored Republic Act 1925, converting the Barotac Nuevo High School (BNHS) into a national school of fisheries known as Central Iloilo National School of Fisheries (CINSOF), with Mr. Amedeo S. Timbol as its first principal. In 1961, the late Don Juan Paranpan donated a lot in Tiwi, Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, and broadened the school’s scope of curricular offerings to include collegiate courses. The passage of R.A. 321 converted the Iloilo National School of Fisheries into the Iloilo Regional School of Fisheries. In 1971, Bachelor of Science in Fishery Education (BSFED), with Dr. Elpidio M. Icamina as superintendent, was offered. In 1975, Bachelor of Science in Fisheries, with majors in Marine Fisheries, Inland Fisheries, and Fish Processing Technology, was offered.</p>
            <p>In 1976, the school broadened its offerings with courses such as: Associate in Agriculture; Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, majors in Animal Husbandry and Agronomy; Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation; and Bachelor of Science in Practical Arts. Another milestone in the history of the school was the offering of Master of Arts in Teaching Vocational Education, in consortium with the Iloilo School of Arts and Trades, Iloilo City. Because of P.D. 1523 signed June 11, 1978, the Iloilo Regional School of Fisheries was converted into the Iloilo State College of Fisheries on August 21, 1978, through the efforts of Dr. Narciso D. Monfort, the leadership of Dr. Elpidio M. Icamina as its first president, and the cooperation of the faculty and staff of the school and the good people of Barotac Nuevo. This marked the birth of the first and only state college of fisheries in the country.</p>
            <p>Iloilo State College of Fisheries offered excellent training in the field of fisheries and advanced education both on campus and other satellite schools. The state college broadened its curricular offerings in Technology, Educational Management, and Public Administration; a postgraduate degree in Rural Development; Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology; Bachelor of Science in Fisheries; Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation; Bachelor in Secondary Education; and Bachelor of Science in Ecological Tourism.</p>
            <p>In 1979, the Marine Science Research Center was constructed in Lapuz-Lapuz, Dumangas, Iloilo. On March 3, 1983, the Old Sagay Barangay High School in Sagay, Negros Occidental, was converted into ISCOF—Sagay Branch. In 1984, the BSMT building was constructed in Alacaygan, Banate, Iloilo. On Dr. Icamina’s retirement, Mr. Benigno P. Panistante was installed as second ISCOF president on July 1, 1987.</p>
            <p>In the 80’s, other programs were approved: Fisheries Management as one of the major fields of BS Fisheries (BSF); a ladderized curriculum of the Bachelor of Science in Marine Transportation (BSMT); and Certificate in Marine Transportation (CMT). The State College of Agriculture ASCA-ISCOF graduate education consortium program on Master of Arts in Educational Management (MAEM), major in Vocational Productivity, was also started</p>
            <p>In 1992, Dr. Elpidio A. Locsin, Jr. was elected as the third president. Major developments were implemented in the College.
            </p>
            <p>In consonance with RA 8760 in 2002, the following CHED-Supervised Institutions (CSIs) were integrated with ISCOF as its Branch Schools: Dumangas Polytechnic College (DPC), Dumangas, Iloilo; Barotac Nuevo Polytechnic Institute (BNPI), Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo; San Enrique Polytechnic College (SEPC), San Enrique, Iloilo; and Dingle Agricultural and Technical College (DATEC), Dingle, Iloilo. Dr. Wenceslao O. Sison, PASUC President, was designated OIC President in view of the vacancy left by Dr. Locsin.
            </p>
            <p>In 2007, the fifth president, Dr. Ramon C. Cabag, was sworn into office. Due to his secondment, he returned to his original school, the West Visayas State University, after two years. The Regional Director of the Commission on Higher Education acted as the OIC President for a year as a result of the vacancy left by Dr. Cabag.
            </p>
            <p>On March 16, 2008, the Board of Trustees installed into office the sixth president, Dr. Ma. Rosario Allones Panes. Dr. Panes started working for the university-hood of the College, with the strong support of the Honorable Congressman Ferjenel G. Biron who sponsored the bill.
            </p>
            <p>On March 17, 2013, Dr. Panes finished her term as SUC President II prompting the Board of Trustees to search for the next president. While the search was ongoing, Dr. Panes assumed as OIC President.
            </p>
            <p>On June 11, 2013 His Excellency Benigno Simeon Aquino III signed into law Republic Act No. 10604, an act converting ISCOF into the Iloilo State University of Science and Technology, the 10th university in the Province of Iloilo, but ISCOF failed to comply with CHED requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, through Board of Trustees Resolution No. 34 series of 2013, Dr. Ramon G. Zarceno was appointed as the seventh ISCOF President on April 15, 2013 and assumed office on June 13, 2013.
            </p>
            <p>Engineer Godelyn Gallega-Hisole formally assumed office as the 8th SUC President II of the Iloilo State College of Fisheries on July 11, 2017, by virtue of the official appointment by the ISCOF Board of Trustees led by Commissioner J. Prospero E. De Vera III of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).
            </p>
            <p>
              Congressman Ferjenel G. Biron of the 4th District of Iloilo sponsored the House Bill that finally led to the enactment and signing into law of Republic Act No. 10604, later amended by RA 11012 signed on April 4, 2018 by His Excellency Rodrigo Duterte, that converted the status of ISCOF to that of a university named Iloilo State University of Fisheries, Science, and Technology, pending CHED compliance.
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Nordy D. Siason, Jr., EdD, CESO VI, assumed office as the 9th President in February 2022, by virtue of the official appointment by the ISCOF Board of Trustees led by Commissioner J. Prospero E. De Vera III of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Siason has been leading ISCOF’s efforts in complying with CHED requirements for full university status. To date, 37 of the 37 (100%) undergraduate and graduate programs of ISCOF across its campuses have been awarded by CHED with Certificate of Program Compliance.
            </p>
            <p>On January 10, 2023, the CHED Commission En Banc approved Resolution No. 019-2023, effectively converting the Iloilo State College of Fisheries (ISCOF) into Iloilo State University of Fisheries, Science, and Technology (ISUFST) with main campus at Barotac Nuevo, and with campuses at Dumangas, Dingle, and San Enrique, all in the province of Iloilo.

             the actual Accreditation Process
          </h2>
          <div class="flex-1">

            <p>
              The whole activity started with planning where everyone of us –
              students- as well as our course facilitator was involved and
              actively participated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two or three physical class sessions were devoted to planning.
              Originally, the class was divided into three groups: one to visit
              and evaluate a private junior high school in Bacolod City, Negros
              Occidental, one in University of Antique and one in the main
              campus of ISUFST. However, due to a reason beyond anyone’s
              control, the class settled to visit the last two state
              universities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specific students were identified who should go with the ISUFST
              group and who should go with the University of Antique. Both were
              to conduct a mock accreditation for the institutions BSED (English
              and Math) degree offerings, specifically, in Area III only using
              the accreditation instrument of AACCUP.
            </p>
            <p>
              A session was spent online in the briefing by the course
              Professor, Dr. Sybel Joy F. Labis on the concept of AACCUP
              accreditation and on how to use its instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Contingencies anent the activity like food and snacks, class
              uniform, transportation, itinerary, etc. were also included in the
              planning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I belonged to the group assigned to visit ISUFST Main Campus in
              Tiwi, Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo on May 12, 2023.
            </p>
            <p>Below was the itinerary for our group:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The group arrived at the area on time. Upon arrival, Dr. Labis
                and the rest made a courtesy call with the University President,
                Dr. Nordy Siason who was around that time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Starting at 2:00 o’ clock PM and the next two hours we conducted
                the mock accreditation. There were two groups: one for the BSED
                major in English curriculum and the another for the BSED major
                in Math curriculum. I belonged to the former group.
              </li>
              <li>
                At around 3:30 o’ clock PM, the class started sharing each
                group’s outputs with Dr. Labis facilitating. The discussion was
                enriching and much have been learned from the insights of one
                another and from the wisdom of the course professor. When the
                sharing had been through, the group started to pick up, did a
                short tour of the campus and took some groufies and pictures
                before parted ways to go each home.
              </li>

              Insights and challenges encountered during the accreditation
              process
            </h3>
            <p>
              Accreditation as an activity or process is not new to me, as I
              mentioned above. I have helped during the accreditations of
              several programs in the university campus I am serving. So
              practically, the activity we conducted at ISUFST Main Campus was
              generally smooth sailing for me personally.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, it is inevitable that there are some minor challenges
              that I encountered during the activity day. Firstly, the distance
              from my place. The site we visited was quite far from our place
              and since I have no private car or service vehicle, I had to
              commute and had to ask a classmate who has a car to wait for me in
              Zarraga, Iloilo so I can hitch ride with him along with our
              professor and two of my classmates. Since travelling by bus is not
              predictable, I came late in our rendezvous. I was ashamed to let
              them wait for me. I hoped they did not wait for me for a long
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, travelling for me is always a challenge since I take
              maintenance medications for my hypertension and diabetes. We
              arrived at the site on time but I had to eat my lunch first in
              their campus cafeteria for me to take my meds. As a consequence,
              I started my tasks quite a little late than the rest of the group.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thirdly, the documents given to us for evaluation were scanned
              copies the University submitted to AACCUP last year when they
              applied for Level 4 status of their BSED program with all the
              field of specializations under it. The fact that the AACCUP
              itself has closed the system, it was a real challenge for us to
              verify the claims especially that most of the claims or documents
              were supplemented by supporting documents that were hyperlinked
              but since the whole sets of documents were in PDF form, there was
              no way for us to click and open those links. Triangulation then
              was a definite challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, although we only looked into Area III - Curriculum and
              Instruction for only one specialization (I was assigned to BSED -
              English group), the time given to us to check the documents
              against the benchmarks in the six parameters of Area III was too
              short for us to have done much. It would have been more enriching
              if time would not have been limited. If we were to count, our
              travel time to and from that place was just equal or even longer
              that the time we spent for the actual doing of the thing.
            </p>

              Lessons learned and personal growth from conducting the
              Accreditation
            </h3>
            <p>
              Generally, the activity was very enriching, fruitful and
              productyive. There were many things I personally learned from the
              whole process starting from the planning stage until the
              culmination of the accreditation day. For one, accreditation is a
              teamwork. Cooperation and participation of everyone in the Team
              are significant for the attainment of the objectives of the
              activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another is that, studying about the things to be done and how to
              do them is also very important. There is no better substitute than
              to go to the battle armed and ready.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, evaluation is a process of being reasonable, just and fair.
              Making judgments should never rely on what are being presented per
              se. Triangulation is a must. If an accreditor thinks that the
              documents presented are lacking, he/she should find all means to
              verify the claims. He/she should always check and go over his /her
              ratings given and compromise or adjust if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the activity refreshed and enhanced the training I
              attended with ACCUP on Outcomes-based Accreditation. Though I have
              not been called by AACCUP to serve as accreditor so far, yet I
              completed a short term training course on it. The activity is a
              welcoming prelude to the Level 4 accreditation that we are
              preparing for come August or September.

          <p>
            Over-all, the activity was successful, enriching and truly a learning experience. It strengthened the  concepts and theories we discussed in class about evaluation in general and about accreditation in particular. 
          </p>
          <p>Indeed, there is wisdom behind the inclusion of this course in the PhD in Education major in Curriculum Development degree program. This is a course that should be retained continued to be made as a specialization course in the said program because of its undeniable importance and relevance to the whole educational system.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and energy of my classmates. Perhaps it was due to their age which spells dynamism and idealism. But doctoral students student be like this in the first place. They should exude passion and diligence in performing the tasks assigned to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I found the experience very enriching. I loved the whole thing. It brings back the freshmemories we in the campus are doing everytime there is accreditation happening. I am always assigned in Area II-Faculty across prgrams. My first hand experiences have made me familiar with the process although I have to admit that reporting was quite a challenge for me. It is really something when stating the results of one’s evaluation in a tactful and cordial manner. My knowledge and background on accreditation increased. My skills expanded and my outlook on evaluation widened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Program design, evaluation and quality assurance, though distinct from each other, are highly related and are indispensable in curriculum development. All of them require thorough planning. The first two (progam design and evaluation), as applied in education, are geared towards ensuring quality assurance. Both of them are major and crucial functions in curriculum development. Progfram designs should always be updated and reviewed. They should go through evaluation periodically to ascertain their responsiveness and relevance. Evaluation equates to quality assurance. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a student of curriculum, I wish I could be given an opportunity to apply in real accreditation setting what I have learned in this course and in the training with AACCUP last time on Outcomes-based Accredation, which is exactly the application of what we did during the mock accreditation in ISUFST. By applying my learnings in actual conduct of accreditations, I could enhance my knowledge and skills and can firsthandedly extend my help in the cause of promoting and ensuring quality education.

          <p>The whole semester of intellectual encounters with my classmates and with my professor were memories that I will cherish always. It has been a pleasant experience engaging with beautiful and bright minds.</p>
          <p>I am grateful to our course professor, Dr. Sybel Joy F. Labis, for competently leading us in this course. Her being accommodating  everytime I reach out to her is always appreciated. </p>  
          <p>I am equally thankful for my classmates for being kind and accommodating too. Your facilitating of things for the good of the class is heartwarming.</p>
          <p>May our paths cross one day as we try to pursue our respective dreams under the realm of curriculum development.</p>
