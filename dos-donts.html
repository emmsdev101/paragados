            To boost research productivity, it would be desirable if the

            research outputs in peer-reviewed journals, which are indexed
            by Scopus or other reputable indexing bodies. Publication
            support and incentives would be very helpful in achieving

          Findings as bases for recommendations should be document-based

        </li>
        <li>
          The Narrative Profile does not cover all claims. As much as
          possible we have to use triangulation for a verified, valid and
          reliable report.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Narrative Profile may exaggerate or understate claims. Some
          claims are well supported, in some cases, you need to look for
          it.

          Approach the writing in a factual, analytical, and reflective
          manner to achieve a reasonable feedback report.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refrain from giving opinions, perceptions, prescriptions, and
          motherhood statements. Substantiate very statement made.

          Demonstrate objective professional judgment, free from bias or

          In case the score initially given by the area lead accreditor is
