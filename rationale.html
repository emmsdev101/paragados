        Importance of accreditation in ensuring quality
        education
      </h3>
      <p>
        Accreditation aims for and promotes quality education. It is very
        important if not indispensable to the whole educational system
        particularly in ensuring that program offerings are at par with
        standards set by authorities and accrediting bodies. When program
        offerings and institutions are accredited, the ones who most
        benefit are the major clients of the educational institutions who
        are the students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, parents become confident that their children are in
        good hands and that they get the worth of their money. Even if we
        say that public education in the Philippines is free across all
        levels, accreditation is a means to determine that the taxpayersâ€™
        money is well spent. After all, quality education is the thrust of all
        stakeholders of an educational institution.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why, even in accreditation processes, there is an
        involvement or presence of students, alumni, community and local
        government officials and whose views and ideas become sources of
        information if not strong bases for triangulation of claims the
        institution or the program being accredited are establishing.

        Explanation of how accreditation enhances program design and
        evaluation
      </h3>
      <p>
        Accreditation enhances program design and evaluation since it is
        the very core of this process. It establishes the credibility of offering
         programs by higher education institutions. The meticulous process of
        accreditation spells out the very essence of evaluation to ensure
        its ultimate end which is quality education.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accreditation ensures also that as degree offering advances in
        terms of number of years which it is being offered, the quality of
        its systems and inputs, its implementation as well as its outputs
        also advances accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also promotes quality of program offerings by setting
        benchmarks amoung institutions with lower-level accreditations
        with those who have already advanced in the field of
        accreditation.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">Personal insights</h3>
      <p>
        Personally, I always believe that accreditation is a potent tool
        to ensure quality and relevant education. My a little more than
        two decades of accreditation experiences in the institution where
        I render service as a faculty member has seen tremendous
        improvements and developments that are in place now because of
        accreditations that have been conducted so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        While meeting the standards of the level a program in trying to
        get and eventually pass is definitely tedious and demanding
        physically, emotionally and mentally; nevertheless, the positive
        result when the level applied for is granted, is fulfilling and
        gratifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        All stakeholders become happy afterwards at the thought that the
        institution that they all support and form part of has indeed
        reasons for existing and for continuing to offer degree programs found
        to be of quality and relevant by the accrediting body.
